      <description>&lt;p&gt;Large carnivores are difficult to monitor in the field: they are elusive and live at low densities over wide areas. With their recent recovery in Europe,
large carnivores are having increasing interactions with human activities. We contribute to the estimation of their abundance and distribution by applying
and developing methods that make optimal use of available data. We are also working on applying science-based management using the structured
decision making
framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ongoing projects are mostly led by 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://oliviergimenez.github.io/#current&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Master students, PhDs and post-docs&lt;/a&gt;: Julie Louvrier worked on tools to infer the
distribution of large carnivores in France and Norway; Loreleï Guéry in her post-doc studied population dynamics of lynx in Switzerland using
spatially-explicit closed and open capture-recapture models; Vincenzo Gervasi&amp;rsquo;s post-doc aimed at assessing the
determinants of conflicts on large carnivores in Europe and build trans-boundary management tools for wolves (France-Italy) and wolverines (Sweden-Norway); Nina Santostasi in her PhD is developing
demographic models for studying hybridizing species, with wolves in Italy as as case study; Lorena Mansilla in her PhD is developing capture-recapture models to assess the population dynamics of social species; Sarah Bauduin&amp;rsquo;s post-doc aims at developing a spatially-explicit agent-based model and software program for assessing lynx viability in France; Lucile Marescot&amp;rsquo;s post-doc aims at developing multispecies occupancy models for large carnivores and their preys.&lt;/p&gt;
